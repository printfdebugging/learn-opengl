## vertex and fragment shaders
- first v runs for each vertex in the model
- then once each vertex has been processed, they have a value i.e the output of vertex shader.
- then fragment shader runs for each pixel and the values assigned
  to the vertices by the vertex shader are interpolated.

remember the cat factor and the dog distance example
